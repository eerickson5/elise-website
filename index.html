        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            When 2020 Lockdown hit I decided it would be a great opportunity to teach myself how to code and try to build a fitness startup.
            That didn't turn out so well, but the skills I learned led me to build a patient arrival management system for the physical therapy clinic I began working at.
            That system turned out to be something other clinics were interested in, and now Call Pad can be found in multiple clinics across Atlanta.
        </p>
        <p>
            I still work at that same physical therapy part-time while I'm studing at FlatIron School for Software Development.
            When I'm not working or studying, you'll find me on a field somewhere in the Southeast chasing after a round plastic object with my friends.
